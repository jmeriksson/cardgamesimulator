# Card game simulator

This repository is a public copy of my hand-in of an assignment in the university course 1DV024 - Object-oriented programming, taught at Linnaues University 2019. A very small portion of the application is provided by the course administration (see [the initial commit](../../commit/a31dad88cb5fe24624e09d4334f57e2a5e14a864) for details), but the main part of the application and its functionality is created by me.
